## My Favorite Art Supplies

##### I would consider myself to be a traditional artist, which is someone who woks with physical meduims rather than digital. Through my years of practicing I've come across a lot of great and really bad art supplies. I'm here to reccomend 3 of my umtilmate favorites and hopefully they'll become some of your favorites as well.

>***Remember the art supplies doesn't make you a better artist, practice is key!***
